Collabration Compass based on Semantic Media Wiki and Mashups

Collaboration Compass (CC) is a micro-wiki system and dynamic wiki system that uses a combination of short posts, charts, tweets, online mash-ups, etc., which are delivered as mini-wiki-widgets, to support on-the-fly social collaboration.
It will be based on Vulcan’s Semantic MediaWiki Plus (SMW+) and Zhejiang University (ZJU)’s semantic mash-up engine (sMash).
